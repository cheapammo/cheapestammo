# Phase 1: Web Scraping Implementation Plan

## Target Retailers (Priority Order)

### Tier 1 - High Volume Retailers
1. **SGAmmo.com** - Large inventory, consistent structure
2. **BulkAmmo.com** - Good pricing, bulk quantities
3. **TargetSportsUSA.com** - Popular, frequent deals
4. **Brownells.com** - Massive inventory, premium brand
5. **MidwayUSA.com** - Comprehensive selection

### Tier 2 - Specialized Retailers  
6. **AmmoMan.com** - Competitive pricing
7. **VelocityAmmo.com** - Fast shipping focus
8. **CheaperThanDirt.com** - Budget options
9. **Sportsman's Guide** - Military surplus
10. **Palmetto State Armory** - AR parts + ammo

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Scraper Architecture
```
scrapers/
├── base_scraper.py          # Common scraping functionality
├── retailers/
│   ├── sgammo_scraper.py
│   ├── bulkammo_scraper.py
│   ├── brownells_scraper.py
│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   ├── proxy_manager.py     # Rotating proxies
│   ├── user_agents.py       # Random user agents
│   └── rate_limiter.py      # Respectful scraping
└── data_processor.py        # Clean and normalize data
```

### 2. Data Points to Extract
- Product name and description
- Caliber/cartridge type
- Bullet weight (grains)
- Bullet type (FMJ, HP, SP, etc.)
- Quantity per box/case
- Current price
- Price per round (calculated)
- In stock status
- Product images
- Retailer name
- Product URL
- Last updated timestamp

### 3. Anti-Detection Measures
- Rotating proxy servers (residential IPs)
- Random user agents
- Request delays (2-5 seconds between requests)
- Session management
- CAPTCHA solving services
- Headless browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)

### 4. Legal Compliance
- Respect robots.txt files
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for IP blocks
- Terms of service compliance
- Fair use data collection

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
- Set up proxy rotation system
- Create base scraper framework
- Implement data storage (PostgreSQL)
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Week 3-4: First Retailer Integration
- Start with SGAmmo (simpler structure)
- Build product page scraper
- Implement data normalization
- Test data quality and accuracy

### Week 5-6: Scale to 3-5 Retailers
- Add BulkAmmo and TargetSportsUSA
- Implement parallel scraping
- Add error handling and recovery
- Create data deduplication logic

### Week 7-8: Advanced Features
- Price history tracking
- Stock status monitoring
- Deal detection algorithms
- Data validation and quality checks

## Alternative Data Sources

### 1. Gun.Deals API Integration
- Some aggregators may have APIs
- Secondary data source validation
- Cross-reference pricing

### 2. Retailer RSS Feeds
- Many retailers have RSS feeds for deals
- Less comprehensive but easier to parse
- Good for deal detection

### 3. Social Media Monitoring
- Twitter/Facebook deal announcements
- Reddit r/gundeals monitoring
- Community-driven deal discovery

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- IP blocking → Proxy rotation
- Site structure changes → Automated testing
- CAPTCHA challenges → Solving services
- Rate limiting → Distributed scraping

### Legal Risks
- Terms of service violations → Legal review
- Copyright issues → Fair use compliance
- Data accuracy → Validation systems
- Retailer complaints → Relationship building

## Success Metrics

### Data Quality
- 95%+ price accuracy
- <5% duplicate products
- 90%+ stock status accuracy
- <1 hour data freshness

### Coverage
- 50,000+ unique products
- 10+ major retailers
- All popular calibers covered
- Competitive price coverage

## Next Steps After Phase 1

1. **Retailer Partnership Program** - Approach smaller retailers for direct feeds
2. **API Development** - Build public API for the aggregated data
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Price trend analysis, deal detection
4. **User Features** - Price alerts, saved searches, wishlists

## Estimated Costs (Monthly)

- Proxy services: $200-500
- Cloud hosting: $100-300  
- CAPTCHA solving: $50-100
- Development time: 160+ hours
- **Total Phase 1**: $350-900/month + development time
